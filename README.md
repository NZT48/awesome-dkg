 OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG) presents a global, open data structure comprised of interlinked knowledge assets, structured in a RDF knowledge graph, hosted on an open, permissionless decentralized network of DKG nodes. It's designed to support [the Verifiable Internet for AI](https://origintrail.io/ecosystem/whitepaper) on the basis of an open, permissionless knowledge economy in which knowledge is the primary asset class.
